First thing I did was make sure I created and configured two VM's. Operating system for vm1 is windows 10 and vm2 is using linux. 
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
What is shown in the highlighted portion is the public IP addess of my windows 10 vm. I then copy this IP address so that I can enter it onto RDP.
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
On RDP is where I plugged in the public IP address of vm1 so that I can connect to it. 
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Once on windows 10 I opened powershell which is a command line tool that allows me to talk with my computer. 
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Now I downloaded windows x64 installer on wireshark which is network protocol analyzer, a tool that lets you see exactly whatâ€™s happening on a network in real time. 
</p>
<br />

</p>
<p>
Once wireshark is downloaded on vm1, you can see where I highlighted, right next to ethernet, there's a scribble of some sort. That is actually wireshark indicating that there is network activity. Now to open up this ethernet apllication, I left it highlighted and clicked on the shark fin on the top left corner of the wireshark program.

</p>
<p>
Here is what is happening on the backend of my computer. A bunch of data be sent over the internet but I am going to filter it so that only ICMP traffic is being shown.
